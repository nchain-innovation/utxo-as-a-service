As noted in the main README.md  the best way to install Rust is to use `rustup`.
This code was developed using rustc `1.60.0`.

Once installed update using:
```bash
rustup update
```

To run unit tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

To format the code:
```bash
cargo fmt
```

For Rust hints:
```bash
cargo clippy
```
